## Hello World!
Hey there, c_cat was here is an art project that aims to document the life of a queer person during the end of time. And to create    rememberances of Art, Nature and Technology both in the physical and digital space.

## Upcoming Projects
Expect stuff like: recepies, media reflections, mild vandalism, stickers with QR codes and coding projects. 

## This website is still under construction. In the meantime feel free to bookmark this page or follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/c_cat.was_here){:target="_blank"}
